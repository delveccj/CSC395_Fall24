### Microservice Educational Example: Flask and Basic Security Practices

This example is designed to help students understand **how to build a simple Flask microservice** and explore the **security implications** of command execution in a web application. The code demonstrates restricted command execution within a microservice, highlighting both microservice basics and the importance of security controls.

> **Educational Focus**: This example showcases both **microservice fundamentals** and **cybersecurity awareness**. It emphasizes how seemingly simple endpoints can become vulnerabilities if not carefully controlled. This is for **educational purposes only** and is *not* intended for use in production environments.

---

### 1. **Code Example**:
   Hereâ€™s how to set up a simple Flask microservice with restricted command execution capabilities:

   ```python
   import subprocess
   from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

   app = Flask(__name__)

   # Basic information endpoint
   @app.route('/info', methods=['GET'])
   def get_info():
       return jsonify({
           'name': 'Student Name',
           'favorite_language': 'Python',
           'fun_fact': 'Loves microservices!'
       })

   # Restricted command execution endpoint
   @app.route('/execute', methods=['POST'])
   def execute_command():
       # Define allowed commands for security purposes
       allowed_commands = ['ls', 'whoami', 'pwd']

       # Get the command from the request
       data = request.get_json()
       command = data.get("command")

       if command not in allowed_commands:
           return jsonify({'error': 'Command not allowed'}), 403

       # Execute the command and return the result
       try:
           result = subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True, text=True)
           return jsonify({'output': result})
       except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
           return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 400

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
   ```

### 2. **Using the Endpoint**:
   To test the endpoint, you can send a `POST` request to `/execute` with a JSON payload specifying one of the allowed commands:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/execute -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"command": "ls"}'
   ```

   This will return the output of the `ls` command.

### 3. **Endpoint Functionality**:
   - The `/execute` endpoint demonstrates restricted command execution, which is useful for understanding **how to control access** within a microservice.
   - This endpoint is limited to a small set of **predefined, harmless commands** (e.g., `ls`, `whoami`), providing a controlled environment to illustrate security concepts.

### 4. **Security Insights**:
   - This example includes **command restrictions** to prevent potentially harmful operations, underscoring the importance of securing command execution capabilities.
   - For educational purposes, it serves as a starting point for understanding how an **unrestricted endpoint** could be misused as a basic command-and-control client, a common feature in malware.
   - **Important**: Never expose an endpoint like this in a production environment without further security hardening, such as authentication, encryption, and command whitelisting.

### 5. **Learning Objective**:
   By working with this example, students gain:
   - Insight into **microservice architecture** and **endpoint creation**.
   - Understanding of **security implications** and **access control**.
   - Practical knowledge of the need for **command restriction** in secure applications.

This project is intended to be a safe, controlled way to learn both **software development and cybersecurity fundamentals**.
