1. **Create an Additional Endpoint**:
   Each microservice can have a new `/execute` endpoint to execute limited, predefined commands (not full terminal access).

2. **Restrict Commands**:
   Allow only a small set of harmless commands (e.g., `ls`, `whoami`, etc.) and disallow commands that can modify the system.

3. **Code Example**:
   Here’s how to set it up in a Flask microservice:

   ```python
   import subprocess
   from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/info', methods=['GET'])
   def get_info():
       return jsonify({
           'name': 'Student Name',
           'favorite_language': 'Python',
           'fun_fact': 'Loves microservices!'
       })

   # Restricted command execution endpoint
   @app.route('/execute', methods=['POST'])
   def execute_command():
       # Define allowed commands
       allowed_commands = ['ls', 'whoami', 'pwd']

       # Get the command from the request
       data = request.get_json()
       command = data.get("command")

       if command not in allowed_commands:
           return jsonify({'error': 'Command not allowed'}), 403

       # Execute the command and return the result
       try:
           result = subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True, text=True)
           return jsonify({'output': result})
       except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
           return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 400

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
   ```

4. **Using the Endpoint**:
   You can send a `POST` request to `/execute` with a JSON payload specifying the command:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/execute -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"command": "ls"}'
   ```

   This will return the output of the `ls` command.

5. **Security Note**:
   - This setup is *highly restrictive* and only for educational purposes.
   - You sort of just created a really, really simple command and control client!
   - **Do not** expose this endpoint in a production environment.
   - Consider logging all commands executed to track usage.

This limited approach allows you to experiment with a “terminal-like” command execution while keeping risks low.
