# Assignment 2: The Business Development Person's 'Vision'

## Intro

Your business development person has done it again. He has hit the road and pitched a vision for a new project. He managed to get just enough funds for four weeks of development time for four to five developers.

### His Vision: The AI-Backed Recipes Maker!

Look at the concept screen drawn out below—it's got the notes and what you need to get the job done. Your instructor understands the vision and can fill in some of the details.

### The Solution Must Be Completely Dockerized!

## Steps to Success

### Section: Create a GitHub Project

1. **Make it Private**: 
   - Someone from your team must create a private GitHub repository.
   - Invite the other team members and the instructor as collaborators.

### Section: Create the Tickets

1. **Discuss the Vision**:
   - Your team needs to discuss what the vision means and how to implement it.
2. **Create the Tickets**:
   - Break down the project into manageable tasks and create GitHub issues (tickets) for each.
3. **Organize into Sprints**:
   - Add the tickets to two one-week sprints.
4. **First Week Milestone**:
   - Ensure the first week ends with a milestone that represents a significant progress checkpoint.
5. **Final Project Milestone**:
   - The second week should culminate with the final product ready for review.

### Section: Project Plan

1. **Document the Plan**:
   - Create a document that explains the architecture, the development plan, how the work will proceed, and how progress will be measured.

### Section: Kickoff and Conclusion Brief

1. **Kickoff Presentation**:
   - Prepare a five-minute kickoff presentation.
   - One person from the team will describe the project plan, challenges, team roles, and expected outcomes.
2. **Conclusion Brief**:
   - Prepare a conclusion brief that demos the final product and lists the challenges overcome along the way.

### Section: Docker

1. **Dockerize the Solution**:
   - Ensure the solution runs as a Docker container.
   - Provide a `docker-compose.yml` that will build the environment and allow the Instructor to run the application easily.
