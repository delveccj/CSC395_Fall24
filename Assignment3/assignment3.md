# Assignment 3: Branching, Pull Requests, Ticket Management, and Testing

## Objective

In this assignment, your team will deepen your understanding of collaborative development practices using GitHub. Each student developer will work on their own branch, the team manager will handle pull requests to merge changes into the main branch, and all team members will be responsible for writing and maintaining tests. Additionally, you will manage and track your progress using GitHub Issues, ensuring that all tasks are properly documented, tested, and completed.

## Requirements

### 1. Branch Creation and Development

- **Each Student Developer:**
  1. Create a new branch off the main branch. Name your branch based on the task you are working on (e.g., `feature-login`, `bugfix-database-connection`).
  2. Work on your assigned task within your branch. Commit your changes regularly with clear, descriptive commit messages.
  3. Write unit tests or integration tests for your code to ensure it functions as expected. Place your tests in an appropriate directory (e.g., `tests/`).
  4. Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the main branch before submitting a pull request.

### 2. Pull Requests, Code Review, and Testing

- **Team Manager:**
  1. Review each developer's pull request for completeness, code quality, and test coverage.
  2. Use GitHub's code review tools to provide feedback and request changes if necessary.
  3. Verify that all tests pass in the branch before approving the pull request.
  4. Once satisfied, merge the pull request into the main branch.

- **Each Student Developer:**
  1. Submit a pull request to merge your branch into the main branch once your task and tests are complete.
  2. Address any feedback provided by the team manager during the code review process.
  3. Ensure all tests pass in your branch before requesting a merge.

### 3. Ticket Management

- **Issue Tracking and Documentation:**
  1. Open a GitHub Issue for each task or feature being developed. The issue should clearly describe the task, its goals, any relevant details, and expected tests.
  2. Throughout the development process, add comments to the issue to document your progress, challenges faced, and how they were resolved.
  3. Include information about the tests written for the feature or fix in the issue comments.
  4. Close the issue once the task is completed, tests have passed, and the pull request has been merged.

- **Additional Requirements:**
  1. New issues should be created if new tasks or bugs are identified during development.
  2. All issues must be assigned to a specific team member and added to the appropriate sprint or project board.

### 4. Monitoring and Reporting

- **Instructor Expectations:**
  1. The instructor will monitor ticket progress to ensure that all tasks are being tracked, tested, and completed on time.
  2. The instructor expects to see regular updates in the form of comments on each issue, detailing progress, testing outcomes, and any obstacles encountered.
  3. The instructor will check the project board to see the flow of issues through the stages of development (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).

## Deliverables

1. **Branches**: Each student should have a branch named according to the task they are working on. The branch should be up-to-date with the main branch and contain all relevant code and tests.
   
2. **Pull Requests**: Each student should submit a pull request for their branch. The pull request should include a detailed description of the changes made, the tests written, and reference the associated GitHub Issue.
   
3. **Tests**: 
   - Tests must be included in the pull request and should cover the functionality introduced or fixed in the branch.
   - All tests must pass before the pull request can be merged.
   
4. **GitHub Issues**: 
   - Each task must have an associated GitHub Issue.
   - Issues should contain detailed descriptions, progress updates, testing information, and comments documenting any challenges faced.
   - Issues must be closed upon the successful merge of the pull request.
   
5. **Project Board**: The project board should clearly show the status of all issues. New issues should be added if additional tasks or bugs are identified, and all issues should be properly categorized and tracked.

## Grading Rubric

| Item                                               | Hi Points                                                     | Med Points                                                  | Low Points                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Branch Creation and Development                    | Branches are well-named, up-to-date, and contain clean, organized commits. | Branches are created and used, but may lack organization or descriptive commits. | Branches are poorly managed, with infrequent commits or unclear branch names. |
| Pull Requests, Code Review, and Testing            | Pull requests are detailed, well-documented, include comprehensive tests, and are properly reviewed. | Pull requests are submitted with some tests, but may lack detail or thorough review. | Pull requests are incomplete, lack tests or documentation, or are not reviewed properly. |
| Ticket Management                                  | Issues are detailed, updated regularly, and accurately reflect progress, including testing information. | Issues are created but may lack updates, testing information, or detailed documentation. | Issues are poorly managed, with minimal updates, testing documentation, or no clear tracking. |
| Monitoring and Reporting                           | All tasks are clearly tracked, with visible progress on the project board, including testing results. | Most tasks are tracked, but some issues may be missing or not updated regularly with testing results. | Task tracking is inconsistent, with significant gaps in issue management or testing documentation. |
