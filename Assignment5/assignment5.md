# **Assignment 5: Kickoff Document and Presentation for Student Identified Projects**  

## **Assignment Overview**  

Your team has selected a project idea that will be developed over **three sprints**. The purpose of this assignment is to prepare a **kickoff document and presentation** that outlines your project plan and communicates the key elements necessary for successful execution.

This **document and presentation** will guide your development process and serve as a blueprint throughout the project lifecycle. Your **kickoff presentation** will be delivered to the instructor and peers to gain feedback and ensure alignment before coding begins.

---

## **Kickoff Document Requirements**  

Your team must create a **Kickoff Document** that includes the following sections:

---

### **1. Project Overview**  
- **Project Name**: Provide a meaningful title for your project.  
- **Project Description**: Briefly describe the problem your project aims to solve.  
- **Target Users/Customers**: Identify the primary users or audience. The user persona and scenario document will be very helpful for this task.  

---

### **2. Technology Stack**  
- **Languages, Tools, and Frameworks**: List the specific technologies your team will use.  
  Example: Python Flask, React, SQLite, Docker, GitHub Actions, etc.  
- **Justification**: Provide a detailed explanation for **why these technologies were chosen**.

---

### **3. Roles and Responsibilities**  
- **Team Member Roles**: Assign a specific role to each member, ensuring that all aspects of the project are covered.  Here are some examples:
  - **Project Manager**: Oversees planning and progress tracking.  
  - **Frontend Developer**: Handles the user interface development.  
  - **Backend Developer**: Manages server logic and API integration.  
  - **Tester**: Develops and runs test suites (unit, integration).  
  - **DevOps Engineer**: Manages Dockerization and CI/CD pipelines.  
- **Contribution Plan**: Include how each member will **consistently contribute** throughout the sprints.  Your team needs to identify how team members will be consistently tasked with work.  

---

### **4. Concept Screens and Data Flow Diagram**  
- **Concept Screens**: Include **mockups** or **wireframes** showing the key screens of your system.  Provide a description of how the user would interact with your system via the mockup.
- **Data Flow Diagram**: Provide a diagram showing the **flow of data** between frontend, backend, databases, and any external services.  Provide a descritpion on how the data flow occurs.

---

### **5. Sprint Plan with Milestones**  
- **Sprint Structure**: Divide your project into **three two-week sprints** with clear deliverables for each.  Here is an example:  
  - **Sprint 1 (Oct 23 - Nov 7)**: Initial setup, core development (e.g., backend, basic UI).  
  - **Sprint 2 (Nov 8 - Nov 21)**: Feature development, UI-backend integration, and tests.  
  - **Sprint 3 (Nov 22 - Dec 5)**: Final polish, testing, bug fixes, and delivery (consider **Thanksgiving** for Sprint 3 planning).  
- **Milestones**: List key **milestones** for each sprint to ensure accountability.

You must create a GitHub project and share it with the instructor.  Your must create a set of fine grained tasks (issues in the GitHub project) that clearly identify the work your team plans to perform in each sprint.

---

### **6. Deployment Strategy and CI/CD Plan**  
You must create a deployment plan for your project that uses the GitHub Actions and workflows!  Specifically:

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Detail your **CI/CD strategy** using **GitHub Actions** (or other tools).  
- **Automation Goals**: Include **unit tests**, **integration tests**, and **automated deployment**.  
- **Containerization**: Specify how Docker will be used to package and deploy your system.

---

### **7. Risks and Mitigations**  
- **Identify at least 3 Risks** your project might encounter (technical challenges, holidays, time constraints, etc.).  
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Propose how you’ll handle each risk.  

---

### **8. Communication Plan**  
- **Meeting Schedule**: How often will your team meet (e.g., weekly standups, sprint retrospectives)?  
- **Tools Used**: What tools will you use for communication (e.g., Discord, GitHub Issues)?  
- **Retrospective Notes**: Add a section explaining that your team will submit a markdown file, `RetrospectiveMeetingNotes.md`, at the end of each sprint summarizing challenges, successes, and improvements.  These notes should be saved in the GitHub repository so they are archived and may be reviewed.

---

### **9. Success Criteria**  
- Define the **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** that will measure your success.  
  Example:
  - 80% of unit tests pass in the CI/CD pipeline.
  - The final product is containerized and runs smoothly.
  - All sprints completed with no more than 3 backlog items carried over.

---

## **Kickoff Presentation Requirements**

Your team will give a **15 minute presentation** that summarizes the key elements of your kickoff document. **Slides** must be prepared and submitted along with the kickoff document in your GitHub repository.

### **Presentation Outline:**
1. **Introduction**: Brief overview of the project and the problem it solves.
2. **Technology Stack**: Highlight key tools, frameworks, and technologies.
3. **Roles and Responsibilities**: Briefly mention the role of each member.
4. **Concept Screens and Data Flow**: Show mockups and explain the flow of data in your system.
5. **Sprint Plan**: Describe the key milestones for each sprint.
6. **Deployment and CI/CD Plan**: Explain how your project will be built, tested, and deployed.
7. **Challenges and Risks**: Outline the main risks and mitigation strategies.
8. **Questions**: Prepare to take questions from the class and instructor.

---

## **Submission Instructions**  
- **Document**: Submit the Kickoff Document in your GitHub repository.  
- **Slides**: Add the **presentation slides** to the GitHub repository.  
- **Presentation**: Deliver your presentation in class as scheduled on October 31, 2024.
