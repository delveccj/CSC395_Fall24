# Assignment 4: Project Two - Developing a Project Guide!

## **Personas & Scenarios Document**

You should submit a Word document (it can exported as a PDF) with these sections in it. A D2L dropbox has been established for this document. You should include in the header of the document the name of your team and the footer should have page numbers.  The document should list the names and contact information of your members at the top.

### **What the Document Should Include**  

1. **Project Overview** (1 point)
   - A short summary of the product vision and who it’s designed for.  This should be minimally a paragraph in length.

2. **Personas (minimally two personas with a maximum of five)** (8 points) 
   - **Name, age, occupation, lifestyle:** Who is this user?  
   - **Goals:** What are they trying to accomplish with the product?  
   - **Pain points:** What challenges or frustrations do they have?  
   - **Motivations:** Why would they use the product?

3. **User Scenarios (minimally two scenarios per persona)**  (8 points)
   - **Situation:** What is the user doing when they interact with the product?  
   - **Goal:** What do they need to accomplish?  
   - **Success Criteria:** How does the product help the user succeed?  

4. **User Stories (minimally six stories - ideally 10)**  (8 points)
   - These are pretty simple - they to help you have traceability to the features you develop:  
     - **“As a [user], I want to [goal], so that [reason].”**

## **Why This Exercise?**  
- **Clarifies project goals** by focusing on **real-world users and use cases**.
- Provides a solid foundation for **design, feature prioritization, and development** in the coming weeks.
- So that teams will have **a concrete document** to guide them throughout the project.
